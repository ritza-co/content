## Javascript vs webassembly
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language, developed by Netscape Communications. It is primarily used for enhancing web pages to provide for a more user friendly experience. JavaScript can be used on the client-side (in the user's browser) or server-side using Node.js. It provides interactive elements to web pages that improve user experience.

WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It is designed as a portable target for the compilation of high-level languages like C, C++, and Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications. It's not meant to replace JavaScript but to work alongside it, allowing developers to take advantage of the strengths of each.

- Consider JavaScript if you are making a web-based application where you need to manipulate HTML DOM, create interactive elements or do client-side programming. It's also useful for server-side programming with the help of Node.js.
- Consider WebAssembly if you have compute-intensive tasks like 3D render, executing algorithms, or game logic. It's used in combination with JavaScript for better performance in web applications. It's also useful if you want to use C, C++, Rust languages for web development.

## Docker vs webassembly
Docker is a platform that uses containerization technology to encapsulate applications and their dependencies into a single portable container. This container can be executed in any environment that supports Docker, ensuring that the application works exactly the same, regardless of where it's run. Docker can manage and isolate application's processes, file systems, and network interfaces.

WebAssembly (often abbreviated as wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It's designed to be a portable target for the compilation of high-level languages like C, C++, and Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications. With WebAssembly, you can run web applications at near-native speed in the browser, without requiring modifications to the original code.

- Consider Docker if you need to consistently deploy and run your applications across different environments. Docker is particularly useful if your application has many dependencies, as these are bundled into the same Docker container as your application code.
- Consider WebAssembly if you're focused on improving the performance of web-based applications, especially computationally-heavy applications. You should also consider WebAssembly if you want to bring the power of languages like C, C++, and Rust to the web platform.

## Kubernetes vs webassembly
Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes provides a framework to run distributed systems resiliently.

WebAssembly (often abbreviated as wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It's designed as a portable target for the compilation of high-level languages like C, C++, and Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

- Consider Kubernetes if you are dealing with application containers and need to automate deployment, scaling and management. It is especially useful if you are working in a cloud environment.
- Consider WebAssembly if you aim to run high-performance applications on the web. If you have a background in C, C++, or Rust and want to deploy your application on the web without sacrificing performance, WebAssembly is a compelling choice.

## Native Performance vs webassembly
Native Performance refers to the execution of software on the machine level without the need for translation or interpretation, which results in the fastest possible performance. This includes but isn't limited to software written in languages like C, C++, and Rust, and compiled directly to machine code specific to a given architecture.

WebAssembly (often abbreviated as wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It allows programs written in high-level languages like C, C++, and Rust to run in a web browser at near-native speed. WebAssembly operates within a safe, sandboxed execution environment and can function alongside JavaScript.

- Consider Native Performance if you require the absolute fastest, most efficient software execution, and your application is not meant to run in a web browser. 
- Consider WebAssembly if you aim to achieve near-native speeds in a web environment, allowing for complex, high-performance applications to be run directly in a user's browser.

## Server Blazor vs webassembly
Server Blazor is a web framework for building interactive web applications with .NET. Instead of running .NET code directly in the browser, it runs on the server and interacts with the user interface over a SignalR connection. This removes the need to ship large .NET runtime with the application, making it faster to load and potentially more secure, as .NET code isn't exposed to the client.

WebAssembly Blazor, on the other hand, is also a web framework for building interactive web applications with .NET. In contrast to Server Blazor, it runs .NET code directly in the browser by leveraging WebAssembly. This makes the application function like a client-side application as all necessary code is loaded in the client browser upon initial load.

- Consider Server Blazor if you want a faster initial load time, reduced data transfer, minimal client-ish profile, and a more secure connection.
- Consider WebAssembly Blazor if you want a fully client-side application, don't have constant server connection reliability or want to leverage browser's capabilities like caching, offline mode, and near-native performance.

## Docker vs kubernetes
Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications. It allows developers to package up an application with all the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. This containerization aspect also ensures app consistency across different computing environments. 

Kubernetes, on the other hand, is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It works with a range of container tools, including Docker, and facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.

- Consider Docker if you're mainly focused on the creation, deployment, and running of your containers.
- Consider Kubernetes if you're seeking a robust platform that helps you manage and orchestrate your Docker containers at scale.
