# airflow vs. prefect vs. step functions vs. dagster vs. dbt vs. jenkins

## Airflow vs. Prefect

Airflow is an open-source platform started by Airbnb and later donated to the Apache Software Foundation that is designed to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It allows you to organize tasks into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and it also offers robust monitoring and alerting functionalities.

Prefect, on the other hand, is also an open-source workflow management system, which has a hybrid model for execution. It includes a cloud component for the orchestration and a local component for the execution of tasks. Prefect focuses on building data pipelines with first-class Python primitives and allowing more dynamic workflows.

* Consider Airflow if you require a mature, community-supported workflow management system with out-of-the-box monitoring capabilities.
* Consider Prefect if you want a modern, Pythonic interface and need to handle dynamic data pipelines with complex dependencies.


## Airflow vs. Step Functions

Airflow is an open-source workflow management system that enables you to define, schedule, and monitor workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). It offers robust monitoring and alerting capabilities, and its ecosystem is supported by a large community.

AWS Step Functions, on the other hand, is a serverless workflow management service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to design and run workflows that string together AWS Lambda functions and multiple AWS services into business-critical applications.

* Consider Airflow if you need a flexible, open-source solution with a broad community and if you're not tightly integrated with AWS.
* Consider Step Functions if you are deeply invested in the AWS ecosystem and want a serverless solution for coordinating multiple AWS services.


## Airflow vs. Dagster

Airflow is an open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows. With its robust ecosystem and large community, Airflow offers strong support for complex workflows and dependencies defined as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

Dagster, on the other hand, is a newer data orchestrator that describes itself as a data-aware and Kubernetes-native workflow system. It allows developers to define pipelines in terms of the data flow between reusable, logical components.

* Consider Airflow if you need a mature and widely-used tool with strong community support and want to define workflows as code.
* Consider Dagster if you are building data-intensive applications and would benefit from its data-centric view of workflows and native Kubernetes support.

## Airflow vs. dbt

Airflow is an open-source tool that allows you to programmatically define, schedule, and monitor workflows. It provides flexibility and robustness in orchestrating complex data workflows.

On the other hand, dbt (Data Build Tool) is a command-line tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their warehouses more effectively. It doesn't orchestrate workflows but rather focuses on the transformation step in ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) processes.

* Consider Airflow if you need a comprehensive tool to manage complex workflows, including but not limited to data pipelines.
* Consider dbt if your main concern is transforming data in your warehouse using SQL and if you're working within the ELT paradigm.

## Airflow vs. Jenkins

Airflow is an open-source tool designed to author, schedule, and monitor complex computational workflows and data pipelines. Its strong community support and ability to define workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) make it powerful for data processing tasks.

Jenkins, on the other hand, is a leading open-source automation server built primarily for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD). It provides numerous plugins to support building, deploying, and automating any project.

* Consider Airflow if your primary use case involves complex data workflows or ETL processes.
* Consider Jenkins if your focus is on software build, test, and deployment automation in the context of CI/CD.

## Dagster vs. Prefect

Dagster is a data orchestrator for machine learning, analytics, and ETL tasks. It describes itself as a data-aware, Kubernetes-native workflow system that allows developers to define pipelines in terms of the data flow between reusable, logical components.

Prefect, on the other hand, is an open-source workflow management system that aims to build data pipelines with Pythonic primitives. It emphasizes handling dynamic workflows, allowing for a higher degree of complexity and control over workflow execution.

* Consider Dagster if you are developing data-intensive applications and prefer a data-centric perspective of workflows, and want native Kubernetes support.
* Consider Prefect if you are looking for a modern, Pythonic interface to manage complex, dynamic data pipelines.

## Dagster vs. dbt

Dagster is a data orchestrator, which defines itself as a data-aware and Kubernetes-native workflow system. It allows developers to build and manage complex data pipelines, focusing on the data flow between logical components.

Dbt (Data Build Tool), on the other hand, is a command-line tool that focuses solely on the transformation phase in the data pipeline (the 'T' in ELT). It helps data analysts and engineers transform data in their warehouses using SQL.

* Consider Dagster if you need a full-fledged data workflow management tool, particularly if you are deploying in a Kubernetes environment.
* Consider dbt if you are primarily concerned with data transformation in your data warehouse and prefer writing pure SQL.
