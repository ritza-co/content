## Latitude vs precision
Latitude is a geographical coordinate that specifies the north-south position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below a point on the earth's surface and the center of the earth) which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Degrees of latitude are parallel which means they maintain a constant distance apart. 

Precision, in the context of technology and computing, refers to the level of detail or exactness that a system (like a GPS or a data analysis system) can provide. For instance, a system that can locate a position within one meter is said to have higher precision than a system that can only locate within 10 meters.

- Consider Latitude if you need to define or understand the north-south position of a point on Earth.
- Consider Precision if you are dealing with systems that require a high level of detail or exactness in their output or operation. Precision is an especially important concept in areas like GPS tracking, data analysis, and manufacturing.
