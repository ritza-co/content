## Iterm2 vs terminal
iTerm2 is a terminal emulator for Mac that provides features that don't exist in the default macOS terminal. It offers advanced features like split panes, full Unicode support, a hotkey window, search, autocomplete, and more. It is fully customizable and allows for better command line navigation.

Terminal is the default terminal application included with macOS. It offers a command line interface to control the UNIX-based operating system. It supports tabs, themes, and basic settings, however, it lacks some of the advanced features offered by third party applications like iTerm2.

- Consider iTerm2 if you want advanced features such as split panes, full Unicode support, a hotkey window, search, and autocomplete. Also consider this option if you want a fully customizable terminal experience.
- Consider Terminal if you are looking for a simple, straightforward terminal experience that is integrated directly into your macOS system. If you don't require advanced customization or features, Terminal can perform all of the basic functions you would expect from a terminal emulator.


## Iterm2 vs warp
iTerm2 is a terminal emulator for macOS that replaces the default Terminal app. It offers extra features that the basic Terminal lacks, such as tab support, a more user-friendly interface, ability to split terminal panes, profiles, and performance improvements.

Warp is a cloud-native terminal developed by the eponymous company, Warp. It seamlessly integrates CLI tools, enables context-aware autocomplete, and offers a robust, developer-friendly environment. Unlike iTerm2, Warp is designed with a modern, collaborative approach and has the ability to share command results easily.

- Consider iTerm2 if you are satisfied with a reliable and advanced terminal emulator for macOS with extra features, improved performance and don't require a lot of team collaboration in your terminal environment.
- Consider Warp if you are looking for a modern terminal with a deep focus on collaboration, cloud-native features, and an efficient workflow that seamlessly integrates with your team's software suite.

Iterm2 is a terminal emulator for macOS that provides a host of features not available in the default macOS terminal. It offers better support for colors, tabs, hotkey windows, and shells. In addition, iTerm2 supports split panes which allows multiple sessions in the same window, and has built-in search functionality.

Kitty is a cross-platform terminal emulator designed for speed and efficiency. It is GPU-accelerated to deliver smooth scrolling and minimal CPU usage. It has a readable and discoverable configuration file in plain text, wide Unicode support, and offers advanced features such as image rendering and unicode character rendering.

- Consider Iterm2 if you're on a Mac and need a robust, feature-rich terminal emulator that provides significant upgrades over the default terminal, such as better tab management and search functionality.
- Consider Kitty if you need a cross-platform terminal emulator that puts a lot of emphasis on speed and efficiency, as well as additional features like image rendering. It's especially suitable if you're careful about resource usage and want a lighter, faster alternative.



## Alacritty vs iterm2
Alacritty is a cross-platform, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator. It's focused on simplicity and performance. The software is considered to be the fastest terminal emulator available, largely due to its GPU acceleration. It is written in Rust and it supports a variety of platforms, including macOS, Linux, BSD, and Windows.

iTerm2 is macOS only terminal emulator. It carries features, customization and integrations not found in the default MacOS terminal, while remaining lightweight and stable for daily use. It supports split panes, search, autocompletion, multilingual input, full Unicode compliance and many more features.

- Consider Alacritty if you are looking for a lightning-fast, cross-platform terminal emulator and value performance above other features.

## Hyper vs iterm2
Hyper is a modern terminal built on open web standards such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It's extensible and hackable with an active community and can be customized via a web-based UI. The terminal is built for developers who want a terminal that is full of features and integrates with their workflows seamlessly.

iTerm2 is a replacement for Terminal and successor to iTerm on macOS. It includes features like split panels, search, auto-completion, and integration with the system clipboard. iTerm2 prides itself on delivering solid performance and useful features like keyboard shortcuts and profiles for different situations.

- Consider Hyper if you want a modern and attractive terminal, you prefer web technologies for customization, or if you value easy access to an active development community.
- Consider iTerm2 if you're a macOS user looking for a versatile terminal that offers advanced features like 'hotkey windows', split panels, and excellent integration with the macOS system. It is also a good choice for users who want more control over their terminal's behavior or aesthetics.


## Alacritty vs kitty
Alacritty is a lightweight, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator. It is focused on being fast and lean, without unnecessary frills or complications, while leveraging the GPU for rendering to offload computation from the CPU. Alacritty is cross-platform, and can run on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Kitty is also a GPU-based terminal emulator, with an array of extra features like window tiling, configurable keyboard shortcuts, and a wide variety of colorful themes. Kitty is also scriptable, providing enhanced flexibility and control to users who need it.

- Consider Alacritty if you are looking for a lean, efficient terminal emulator with a no-nonsense attitude and cross-platform compatibility.
- Consider Kitty if you desire a terminal emulator that offers a more customizable and feature-rich user experience, whilst also leveraging GPU rendering for speed.


## Alacritty vs warp
Alacritty is a free and open-source terminal emulator written in Rust. It is designed to be fast and comes with GPU-acceleration capabilities. Alacritty aims to maintain simplicity while providing excellent performance and a clean design. It does not come with as many features as other terminal emulators, but instead focuses on speed and low resource usage.
