## Snowflake vs star schema
Snowflake schema is a type of multidimensional model used in data warehouse design. It is more normalized than a star schema and requires more joins to execute a query. For complex categories of data, snowflake schema becomes an ideal choice due to its structured hierarchy of entities and their relationships.

Star schema is another type of data modeling used, particularly, in data warehouses and data marts, where simplicity of use is a critical outcome. It is the simplest form of a dimensional model, where data is organized into facts and dimensions, and it is straightforward to navigate, making it suitable for business users.

- Consider Snowflake schema if your data is complex and categorized. It allows more normalized data storage with reduced data redundancy. Snowflake schema is also beneficial if the system has a lot of dimensions and hierarchies.
- Consider Star schema if simplicity and ease of use are your primary concerns. It is excellent for performing simple queries and is easily understandable by business users. In systems where write operations are not frequent but read operations are more prevalent, this model can offer significant performance advantages.

## Bigquery vs snowflake
BigQuery is a web service from Google that is used for handling and analyzing big data. It's part of Google's Cloud Platform and is built to operate on an elaborated version of SQL. It excels in high-speed analysis of large datasets.

Snowflake is a cloud-based Data Warehouse platform provided by Snowflake Inc. It has a unique architecture that allows users to just load the data and start running queries. Unlike traditional data warehousing platforms that only function with structured data, Snowflake can also process semi-structured data.

- Consider BigQuery if you are already heavily invested in the Google ecosystem or if you anticipate operating on a massive scale where BigQuery's economy of scale can be cost-effective.
- Consider Snowflake if your data warehousing needs include large amounts of structured and semi-structured data. Snowflake might also be a better choice if you require broader multi-cloud support across AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.
