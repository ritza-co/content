# sqlite vs. mysql vs. postgresql vs. sql

## Mysql vs sqlite
Mysql is an open-source relational database management system that is widely used for web-based applications. Mysql supports numerous functionalities such as multiple users, large databases, and complex transactions, making it a powerful choice for heavy-duty data processing and storage needs. 

SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, and zero-configuration database engine that is best suited for embedded databases, such as in mobile apps, desktop applications, and other systems where simplicity and minimal setup are key considerations. It is typically used for local/single-user applications.

- Consider Mysql if you need a powerful, robust database for multi-user applications, large datasets, complex transactions, or web-based applications needing a scalable relational database system.
- Consider SQLite if your requirements are simple or if you're developing a desktop or mobile app that requires an embedded database with minimal setup and easy data access for single-user applications.


## Postgresql vs sqlite
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system that supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying. PostgreSQL is a robust system that provides transactional integrity, supports a high level of concurrency and comes with a number of extensions and libraries that extend its capabilities. It's suited for dealing with a high volume of complex data and used in big web applications, like Instagram and Disqus.

SQLite is a self-contained, high-reliability, embedded, full-featured, public-domain, SQL database engine. Rather than a client-server database engine, SQLite is embedded into the end program. It's excellent for embedded systems or situations where a lightweight, serverless, and zero-configuration database is required. For example, it is used on every Android and iPhone device to store data for mobile applications.

- Consider PostgreSQL if you are running a complex, web-based application, and need a database system that supports high levels of concurrency, transactions, and multi-version concurrency control (MVCC).
- Consider SQLite if your application requires an embedded database, or if you need a lightweight database with minimal setup or administration. SQLite is also a good choice for prototyping, or for small applications with storage size of several GB or less.


## Sql vs sqlite
SQL is a standard language for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS) or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It allows you to create, retrieve, update and delete database records. 

SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, and zero-configuration database engine. It's popular for embedded database systems due to its small size and full feature set. SQLite implements most of the SQL-92 standard for SQL.

- Consider SQL if you're developing a robust, scalable, or multi-user application. SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server, offer great performance, can handle a large amount of data, have better utilities for backup, restoration, and are more secure.
- Consider SQLite if you are developing a small to medium-size application, a prototyping or lightweight app, or need an embedded database. SQLite is easy to set up, doesn't require a separate server, and provides all the features of traditional SQL databases in a more compact package.

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) based on Structured Query Language (SQL). MySQL runs on virtually all platforms, including Linux, UNIX and Windows. It is primarily used for web database management due to its speed and reliability.

PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is an open-source object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) that emphasizes extensibility and technical compliance. It offers advanced data types, robustness and performance optimization, as well as complex queries, foreign keys, triggers, and stored procedures.

- Consider MySQL if you prioritize speed and efficiency, or if you're developing a website or application that doesn't require complex transactions or concern over data integrity.
- Consider PostgreSQL if you need advanced features, complex queries, or custom procedures for a large system where you want to ensure complete ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance.


## Mysql vs sql
MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) used for web databases. It uses structured query language (SQL) for managing data held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system. MySQL is known for its speed, reliability, ease of use, and flexibility.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database. Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, and Ingres.

- Consider MySQL if you are developing a web application, especially in conjunction with PHP, and need a fast, reliable, and flexible RDBMS.
- Consider SQL if you are interacting with relational databases in general, across multiple platforms (Oracle, MS SQL Server, etc.) and need a standardized language for managing and manipulating the data.


## Postgresql vs sql
PostgreSQL is an open-source object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) that offers extensibility and SQL compliance. It's known for its robustness, strong standards compliance, and an array of features, such as complex queries, foreign keys, triggers, and views, among others. Beyond standard SQL data types, PostgreSQL supports geometric, network address, and JSON types.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for managing and manipulating databases. It's not a database system itself, but a tool used to communicate with databases. You can use SQL to perform operations like insert, select, update, delete, create, and alter data in databases.

- Consider PostgreSQL if you are looking for a comprehensive, open-source, and extensible database management system that supports a wide variety of data types, complex querying, and high data integrity.
- Consider SQL if you need a universal language to manage and manipulate data in your databases, regardless of the specific database management system you are using. As a language, it's versatile and used across many different database systems, not a standalone database solution like PostgreSQL.
