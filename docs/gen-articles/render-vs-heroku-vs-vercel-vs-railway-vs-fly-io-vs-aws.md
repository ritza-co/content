# render vs. heroku vs. vercel vs. railway vs. fly.io vs. aws

## Heroku vs. Render

Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that abstracts away infrastructure management, enabling developers to focus purely on application code. It supports multiple languages and offers a robust add-on ecosystem for extending your applications, but its pricing can escalate with scale and it lacks some advanced customization options.

Render, on the other hand, is a newer, fully-managed cloud platform. It provides the simplicity and convenience of Heroku, but extends further with features like SSD-based storage, private networking, and more. Render's pricing is also generally more affordable than Heroku's, especially as your application scales.

* Consider Heroku if you're building a prototype or a small-to-medium scale application, need support for multiple languages, or want to take advantage of a mature add-on ecosystem.
* Consider Render if you need more advanced features (like private networking), if pricing is a key factor, or if you're building a larger, more scalable application.

## Render vs. Vercel

Render is a fully-managed cloud platform, aiming to offer a user-friendly way to deploy applications, static websites, and more. Render provides a wide range of features, such as SSD-based storage, private networking, and built-in support for many programming languages and frameworks.
